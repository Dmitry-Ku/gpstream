# Changelog

All notable changes to gpstream are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Bug fixes found by the config-file semantic audit

- `--no-redistribute` no longer short-circuits `Validate()`: an early
  `return nil` made every later check (verify mode, copy mode, frame-ack
  values) unvalidated whenever the flag was present.
- Default `--timeout` is now **120s**, matching the spec (F-10 §6
  "--timeout (default 120 s)"); it was 60s.
- Config FILE `small_table_threshold` now accepts the same size notation as
  the CLI (`1M`, `512K`, `2G`, `1T`, or plain bytes) instead of plain bytes
  only.
- `--consistent-tables` / `GPSTREAM_CONSISTENT_TABLES` still error against
  the default DB scope (documented mutual exclusion kept); this remains a
  known sharp edge (see docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

### Renamed `--workers` to `--workers-per-pair`

The CLI flag is now named exactly like its config-file key
(`workers_per_pair`, dashes→underscores) and env var
(`GPSTREAM_WORKERS_PER_PAIR`), per the naming rule: *the name in the docs
without the leading `--` is the file key*. No alias for `--workers` (pre-1.0
rename; docs, man page, tests and examples updated).


### Added

- `run` CLI contract per v4 §8: `--metadata-only` / `--data-only` (F-11;
  no `--include` flag — it duplicated the two shorthands and the default),
  `--zstd-level` (1–19), `--no-redistribute`, `--streams` / `--workers-per-pair`.
- TOML configuration file support (`--config file.toml`, F-05) alongside YAML;
  precedence CLI > env > file > defaults.
- `doctor` self-diagnosis (F-16) with precise problem list.
- `internal/topology` package: single source of truth for the Greenplum
  catalog (`gp_segment_configuration`, 8 columns). `IsGreenplum`/`Read`/
  `SegmentCount`/`UpCount`/`ProbeSQL`; `doctor` now reuses it instead of
  duplicating catalog SQL (dedup, v4 §9 layout).
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
